## Real Estate Management Application

<sub> 
  The goal is to build a real estate management application. Users can register with the application as either a renter or agent, add their payment information and personal details, and search and book properties if desired. 
  The project has three deliverables, ER-model, relational schema and the application in Java. The project is connected to the database stored in PostgreSQL server. For the backend, I applied object-oriented programming logic in the development.
